# FreqFucker Ultra

**Tool Category**: Network, Signal Jamming  
**Device Type**: BLE Jammer, Scanner, Analyzer, Spoofer

## Overview

FreqFucker Ultra is a powerful multi-functional device Inspired from CiferTech designed to analyze, jam, spoof, and disrupt Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. Based on the ESP32 Wroom32 module, it comes equipped with advanced features to target and attack Bluetooth devices. Whether you're performing red team engagements or studying BLE networks, this tool serves multiple purposes, from signal analysis to jamming and spoofing.

### Key Features
- **Signal Jamming**: Jams BLE signals across a wide range of devices.
- **Signal Scanning**: Provides scanning capabilities for nearby BLE devices.
- **Signal Spoofing**: Capable of spoofing BLE signals to impersonate legitimate devices.
- **BLE Analyzer**: Analyzes BLE packets and interactions between devices.
- **Sour Apple**: Exploits vulnerabilities in BLE devices by injecting malicious signals.

This tool is ideal for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and hobbyists who need a reliable BLE jammer and analyzer. Its compact design and wide array of features make it an essential tool for wireless security assessments.

## Features & Capabilities
